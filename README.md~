# hive-C-exam

Goal: take 10 times the exam, pass 5 times (50% pass).

How: 
1) take every exam (10 exams -> until August 2-9)
2) Focus 100% on preparing until I pass once.
3) When I pass once, reduce to 2.5 days / week (Friday, Monday, Tuesday before exam)
4) Twice, reduce to Monday, Tuesday
5) After 3 times, only Tuesday. Increase if I fail.

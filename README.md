# hive-C-exam - all code for learning purposes

Aug 2 update:
- situation: failed revwstr and floodfill, when I knew of them from before. not sure how to prepare.
- challenge: I seem to have issues focusing on details
- goal: prepare like before but better to pass it and get it behind.

How: 
- only focus on exam prep: I only have 2 full days, and anything can happen.
- focus on my mistakes: review the level 4s.


_____________________________

Note: All code writing here is focused on learning purposes, to focus on the coding logic and key aspects.
All code here is first draft.

Goal: take 10 times the exam, pass 5 times (50% pass).

Overall plan: 
1) take every exam (10 exams -> until August 2-9)
2) Focus 100% on preparing until I pass once.
3) When I pass once, reduce to 2.5 days / week (Friday, Monday, Tuesday before exam)
4) Twice, reduce to Monday, Tuesday
5) After 3 times, only Tuesday. Increase if I fail.

Lesson learned:
- At last exam, I was blocked too long on level 3 and 4.

Exam strategy:
1) Focus on reaching exam lvl 5, by studying well levels below
2) then focus only on exam lvl 5, skip 

Daily Habit:
- Start from level 0, redo without help all. from level 0.
- first time, you can do with help, but write notes. redo without help next day.
- go level by level. Don't go to next level until last level is mastered
- once you are at level 5,know by heart one or two and skip.

Reminder - :Stdheader in vim; fn + f2;
to log in: exam / exam, open a terminal, command 'examshell', log in. 

LEVEL 0
- reminder: int	main(int argc, char  * * argv)
- to compile: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra aff_a.c -o aff_a

NEXT STEP: do at least the 6 of Level 0.
